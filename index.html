					Adam and I had planned a trip hiking in the White Mountains. What we did not anticipate was how much rain there would be.
					</p>
					<p><img src="images/hole.jpg"><br>
					After a long day with many miles hiked and soaked clothing and gear we set up for the night. It was then we discovered a hole in the tent. This made our sleeping far less comfortable and dry than we hoped.
					</p>
					<p id="end"><img src="images/hamburger.jpg"><br>
					The next day featured many more miles of hiking, none of which were more dry than the day before. So we used some of those miles to leave the wilderness.
